#  README

Some kind of 2D game. No idea what it will be for, yet. Perhaps
multiplayer. It's very barebones, you just drag a line around and it has
an INI parser. The repo will eventually be renamed and something will be
done with this, hopefully.

Ideas are to add code for UDP/IP, a server, and Lua integration.

On \*nix, it should build if you have SDL 2.0 and type `make'.
